Summary:
An Arduino-compatible graphical gauge widget library for flight displays.

Description:
The GaugeWidgets library provides four main scalable graphical elements:
- A vertical bar,
- A horizontal bar, 
- Arc or circular bar, and
- Rotable and Scalable numeric vector fonts.

Each gauge has up to five programmable color ranges with eight definable pointers,
and eight definable pointer types (various arrows, bars, bugs, and needles). 

Each pointer type has a particular shape, a programmable color, and a single character 'tag' 
that helps when labelling pointers.

Each gauge also supports optional graduation marks. Also, text datum points are available after a widget has
been drawn that assist in placing text labels near the minimum and maximum points of the gauge.
