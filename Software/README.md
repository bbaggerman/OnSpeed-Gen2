This folder holds all the software related files. There are three software branches:\
\
OnSpeedTeensy - The Arduino based code that runs on the main Teensy 3.6 chip.\
\
OnSpeedWifi - The Arduino based code that runs on the ESP32-PICO-KIT-D4 Wifi chip.\
\
OnSpeed_hardware_test - Arduino based code that runs on the Teensy 3.6 to test newly built hardware\
\
All .ino files are compiled with Arduino 1.8.7\
\
The Teensy chip also requires TeensyLoader 1.47 https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html
\
All the libraries necessary to compile the above code are included in the /libraries folder.
