The **Arduino** folder contains all the software related files. There are three software branches:\
\
**OnSpeedTeensy_AHRS** - The Arduino based code that runs on the main Teensy 3.6 chip.\
\
**OnSpeedWifi** - The Arduino based code that runs on the ESP32-PICO-KIT-D4 Wifi chip.\
\
**OnSpeed_hardware_test** - Arduino based code that runs on the Teensy 3.6 to test newly built hardware\
\
All .ino files are compiled with Arduino 1.8.16\
\
The Teensy chip also requires TeensyLoader 1.55 https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html
\
All the libraries necessary to compile the above code are included in the **/libraries** folder.
