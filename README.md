# OnSpeed-Gen2
Gen2 - OnSpeed open source hardware and software

This is a device that provides simple and intuitive Onspeed tone cues that allow the pilot to hear key performance AOA's as well outstanding progressive stall warning. ONSPEED AOA is used for approach and landing, assists with maximum performance takeoff and provides optimum turn performance.  The aural logic simplifies energy management and helps the pilot maintain positive aircraft control.

The current Gen2 device is avionics independent. The current features include:

    Measures differential pressures from an AOA pitot tube
  
    Measures static pressure
  
    Receives, parses and logs several types of EFIS data for testing purposes
  
    Receives, parses and logs flight test boom data for testing purposes
  
    Calculates a differential pressure based calibrated Angle of Attack and uses it to generate the OnSpeed tones.
  
    Can be wired directly into the aircraft's audio panel.
  
    It logs all data at 50Hz to the onboard SD card and provides an experimental AOA display via its Wifi interface.
  
    Logs can also be downloaded via Wifi.

We are happy to collaborate and answer any questions.  We will work with any experimenter or manufacturer that is interested in adapting the logic and always welcome qualified volunteers that want to join the project. Email us at team@flyonspeed.org to get in touch.
